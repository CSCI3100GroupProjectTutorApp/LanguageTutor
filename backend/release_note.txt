Language Tutoring Application Release Notes
Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release
We are excited to announce the initial release of the Language Tutoring Application! This version provides a foundation for interactive language learning, focusing on vocabulary building, practical tools like OCR, and flexible usage with offline capabilities and a licensing model.

Key Features:

User Accounts: Easily register and log in to personalize your learning experience.

Personalized Vocabulary: Add, view, edit, and delete your own vocabulary words with detailed information (meanings, parts of speech, context). Search through your saved words to quickly find what you need.

OCR Text Extraction: Use your device's camera or upload images to quickly extract text and add new words to your vocabulary list.

Offline Access & Synchronization: Continue adding and managing vocabulary even without an internet connection. Your data will automatically synchronize with the cloud database once you're back online.

License Management: Access premium features through a licensing system. Request and activate a license to unlock additional capabilities (e.g., protected data/content).

Core Backend APIs: A robust backend supporting all application features, including secure authentication, data storage (MongoDB), and integration with external services (mocked in testing for Youdao, Google Cloud Vision).

Improvements and Bug Fixes in this Release:

Implemented secure user registration and login flows.

Ensured reliable token-based authentication for accessing protected user data.

Developed comprehensive API endpoints for vocabulary management (CRUD, search, retrieval).

Integrated OCR functionality for text extraction from images.

Established a basic offline storage mechanism (simulated with SQLite in testing) and backend synchronization logic.

Introduced a foundational license request and activation system.

Addressed various backend bugs related to data handling, error responses, and authentication/authorization logic identified during testing.

Improved input validation across key backend endpoints to enhance security and data integrity.

Known Issues:

Complex data conflict resolution scenarios during offline synchronization may not be fully automated and might require manual intervention in some cases.

Performance under very high concurrent user load has not been extensively tested or optimized yet.

Comprehensive security testing against advanced attack vectors is ongoing.

The mocked external API calls in the test suite mean that the actual integration with live Youdao or Google Cloud Vision services needs separate verification in a staging/production environment.

Specific UI/UX aspects related to new features will be refined in future frontend updates.

We are committed to continuously improving the Language Tutoring Application. Stay tuned for future updates that will include features like translation support, learning progress tracking, and more!
